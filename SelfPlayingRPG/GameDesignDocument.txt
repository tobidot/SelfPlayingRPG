***	Story
* The story is realy not important to this game.

The player summoned into a new land from a portal of unkown material.
His soul was created during the summoning, so he has no abilities at all.
He is like a newborn, yet he has the intellect and body of a grown up.
Only one simple instruction is given to him: "Live!".

*** World

The world is random generated and possibly infinite in size.
Only the world around a certain range of charatcers will be updated.

*** Environement

The game has multiple environemental regions.
The areas can be small or very large at scale.
Any type of region can neighbour another, there is no restriction in that regard.
These terrains are static, once the region is generated it stays the same forever.
Each terrain has some properties that influence things within this region.
The properties of a terrain type might change during the game though.
These properties are 
	- Rain Start Chance		0 - 100 %	/ min
		// How often does it rain
	- Rain Heavyness		liters / min
		// This determines how heavy a rainfall gets
	- Temperature Day		[ -60°C ] - [ +60°C ]
	- Temperature Night		[ -60°C ] - [ +60°C ]
	- Temperature Deviation		[ 0°C ] - [ 30°C ]
		// How much can the temperature differ from the standard
	- Brightness Day		0 - 100 %
	- Brightness Night		0 - 100 %
		// 0% is total darkness, while 100% means absolute illumination
	- Texture Set
		// How does the basic terrain looks like


*** Gameplay

The Gameplay is simple.
You can move your character with w,a,s,d.
A main weapon can be used with left mouse button, 
while a off hand item is on the right mouse button.
Attacking is possible while moving.
A Monster or character hit by an attack gets damage and a slight knockback.
Monster are unable to attack when knocked back.
When a monster dies it allways drops the same items, but the amount may varry.
When a character dies he is in a KO state, from wich he needs some time to recover and gets teleported back to the base when ready.

Monster and Characters share the same stat-set that determines they fighting power.
